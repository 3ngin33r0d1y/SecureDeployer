# Vault Integration Implementation Report

## Overview
This document provides a detailed explanation of the changes made to implement HashiCorp Vault integration in the deployment-tracker application. The implementation includes:

1. Vault AppRole authentication
2. Fetching database credentials from Vault
3. S3 Scality integration for file storage
4. Fetching S3 credentials from Vault

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- `node-vault`: For Vault API integration
- `aws-sdk`: For S3 integration

### 2. New Configuration Files
- `server/config/vault.js`: Implements Vault AppRole authentication and credential retrieval
- `server/config/s3.js`: Implements S3 file storage functionality with Vault credentials

### 3. Modified Files
- `server/config/db.js`: Updated to fetch database credentials from Vault
- `server/controllers/DeploymentController.js`: Modified to use S3 for file storage instead of local disk

### 4. Testing
- `test-integration.js`: Test script to verify Vault and S3 integration
- `.env.example`: Example environment file with required Vault and S3 configuration

## Vault Configuration Requirements

### Vault Secrets Structure
The implementation expects the following secret paths in Vault:

1. Database credentials: `secret/data/deployment-tracker/database`
   ```json
   {
     "PGUSER": "your_db_user",
     "PGHOST": "your_db_host",
     "PGDATABASE": "your_db_name",
     "PGPASSWORD": "your_db_password",
     "PGPORT": "5432"
   }
   ```

2. S3 credentials: `secret/data/deployment-tracker/s3`
   ```json
   {
     "S3_ACCESS_KEY": "your_s3_access_key",
     "S3_SECRET_KEY": "your_s3_secret_key",
     "S3_ENDPOINT": "your_s3_endpoint",
     "S3_REGION": "your_s3_region"
   }
   ```

### AppRole Authentication
The application uses Vault's AppRole authentication method. You need to:

1. Set up an AppRole in your Vault server
2. Configure the role with appropriate policies to access the database and S3 secrets
3. Add the Role ID and Secret ID to your environment variables

## Environment Variables
Update your `.env` file with the following Vault-related variables:

```
VAULT_ADDR=http://your-vault-server:8200
VAULT_ROLE_ID=your-role-id
VAULT_SECRET_ID=your-secret-id
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
```

## How It Works

### Database Connection
1. The application attempts to authenticate with Vault using AppRole credentials
2. Upon successful authentication, it fetches database credentials from Vault
3. These credentials are used to establish a database connection
4. If Vault authentication fails, it falls back to using credentials from environment variables

### File Storage with S3
1. Files are temporarily stored on disk during upload
2. The application authenticates with Vault to get S3 credentials
3. Files are uploaded to S3 using these credentials
4. The S3 object key is stored in the database instead of a local file path
5. When a file is requested, a pre-signed URL is generated for temporary access
6. Temporary files are automatically cleaned up after upload

## Testing
To test the integration:

1. Configure your Vault server with the required secrets
2. Update your `.env` file with Vault AppRole credentials
3. Run the test script: `node test-integration.js`

The test script verifies:
- Vault authentication
- Database credential retrieval
- S3 credential retrieval
- Database connection with Vault credentials
- S3 connection with Vault credentials
- S3 file upload functionality

## Fallback Mechanism
For resilience, the application includes fallback mechanisms:
- If Vault authentication fails, database connections will use credentials from environment variables
- If S3 credential retrieval fails, S3 operations will use credentials from environment variables

## Security Considerations
- Vault tokens are never stored persistently
- AppRole credentials should be rotated regularly
- S3 pre-signed URLs have a limited validity period (1 hour by default)
- Temporary files are immediately deleted after upload to S3
